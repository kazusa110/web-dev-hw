This assignment was difficult but rewarding for me, because
- I have never used any coding to make project so using code was hard.
- Using all of Atom, Github desktop application and web version of Github to make project was still difficult.  
- I had many issues when I was doing assignment but doing same things over and over for fixing the problem was worth it for me.
