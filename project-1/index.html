    <h2>Tomorrow Never Comes</h2>

    <p>
      <br />
      I knew it would be the last time that I’d see you fall asleep,<br />
      I would tuck you in more tightly, and pray the Lord your soul to keep.<br />
      If I knew it would be the last time that I’d see you walk out the door,<br />
      I would give you a hug and kiss, and call you back for just one more.<br />
      <br />
      If I knew it would be the last time I’d hear your voice lifted up in praise,<br />
      I would tape each word and action, and play them back throughout my days.<br />
      If I knew it would be the last time, I would spare an extra minute or two,<br />
      To stop and say “I love you,” instead of assuming you know I do.<br />
      <br />
      So, just in case tomorrow never comes, and today is all I get,<br />
      I’d like to say how much I love you, and I hope we never will forget.<br />
      Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike,<br />
      And today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight.<br />
      <br />
      So, if you’re waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today?<br />
      For if tomorrow never comes, you’ll surely regret the day<br />
      That you didn’t take that extra time for a smile, a hug, or a kiss,<br />
      And you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish.<br />
      <br />
      So hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear,<br />
      That you love them very much, and you’ll always hold them dear.<br />
      Take time to say “I’m sorry,” “Please forgive me,” “thank you” or “it’s okay”.<br _>
      And if tomorrow never comes, you’ll have no regrets about today.<br />
    <p/>
