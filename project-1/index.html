    <p>
      <br />
      I knew it would be the last time that I’d see you fall asleep,<br />
      I would tuck you in more tightly, and pray the Lord your soul to keep.<br />
      If I knew it would be the last time that I’d see you walk out the door,<br />
      I would give you a hug and kiss, and call you back for just one more.<br />
      <br />
